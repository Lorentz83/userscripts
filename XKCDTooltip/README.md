XKCD tooltip
============

**Summary**: This script puts the xkcd tooltip under the picture in
both xkcd comic and xkcd what-if. In the comics add also a link to
[http://www.explainxkcd.com](explainxkcd.com).

Why canâ€™t I read the whole comic mouseover in xkcd.com?
From the faq in the site: "They can be read with extensions like Long
Titles, or by right-clicking on the images and going to 'properties',
then clicking and dragging to read the whole thing".

Or you can install this script for greasemonkey that add the image
tooltip under the image itself.
