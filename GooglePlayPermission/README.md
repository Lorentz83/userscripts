Google Play Permission
======================

**Summary**:
List app permissions in Google Play search result page.
Click on a permission to delete from the page every app that request it.

**Note**
This script is still in beta testing.
Although I'm developing it since long time, Google messes up very
frequently the PlayStore pages.

Some known issues:
- a refresh is usually required when the pages hang up loading;
- permissions should be presented in different ways according to their
  "dangerousness";
- when a permission is filtered, the restoring doesn't properly work.

## Changelog

### Version 2.3
- now it works also when the user is logged!

### Version 2.2
- restored on 2015-04-09
