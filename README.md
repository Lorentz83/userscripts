Greasemonkey user scripts
=========================

This repository collects my greasemonkey userscripts since
UserScripts.org has fallen into disrepair.

The scripts I consider stable are online also on 
[GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/3315-lorentz83) and
[OpenUserJS](https://openuserjs.org/users/Lorentz83).
The others are experiments that I still consider in beta.  

Each directory contains a user script and its README file.
