Google Images direct link
=========================

**Summary**: This script adds direct links to images and pages in
google image search. 
Works in Chrome, Firefox and Opera. Please report any bug, I use only
Firefox, so some updates my break other browsers compatibility.

If you don't like the frame that Google Images leave in the pages when
you click on an image, this script is for you.
For each result image this script changes the link to point directly to
the image, and add another link that points to the page that holds the
image.

Opera users please read [this](http://www.opera.com/docs/userjs/using/#securepages).

To install in google chrome Google chrome follow
[this](http://techie-buzz.com/browsers/chrome-blocking-extension-apps-scripts-chrome-web-store.html)
instructions or use the extension
[Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en).

**Note:** The basic search is now broken.
